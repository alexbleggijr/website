# React Native

:::note
In order to build my knowledge repository, after 10 years of experience in web development, I found interesting to recycle the knowledge I had previously. For this reason, certificates are presented from 2024 onwards.

## About

- **727 Classes**
- **5 Challenges**
- **65 Tests**

On this trail you will learn about the essential topics of React for mobile, venture into the ecosystem and learn in practice all the possibilities that this library has to offer. The trail starts with the introduction with the three pillars of the library: State, Property and Component and takes you to putting the applications into production, with automated testing and deployment.

With a more practical approach, you will create several projects along the way, from simpler applications such as a to-do list to the development of monitoring a fleet of vehicles.
