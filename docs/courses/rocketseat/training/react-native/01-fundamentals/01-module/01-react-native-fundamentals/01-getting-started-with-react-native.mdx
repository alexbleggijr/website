## [What is React Native](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/projeto-01/group/iniciando-com-react-native/lesson/o-que-e-react-native-1)

In this theoretical class you will better understand what React Native is and on which platforms it can be used.

## [Who uses React Native](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/projeto-01/group/iniciando-com-react-native/lesson/quem-usa-react-native)

In this theoretical class you will be introduced to the [React Native Showcase](https://reactnative.dev/showcase), showing the main companies that use React native and on which platforms.

## [What is Expo?](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/projeto-01/group/iniciando-com-react-native/lesson/o-que-e-expo)

In this theoretical class you will learn about the two main ways to create React Native projects today: React Native CLI and Expo CLI. Additionally, as we will focus on Expo throughout the journey, we will delve deeper into the [Bare and Managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) workflows
