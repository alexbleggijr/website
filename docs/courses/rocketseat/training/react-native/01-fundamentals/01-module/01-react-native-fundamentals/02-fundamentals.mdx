# Fundamentals

## [Preparing your Development Environment](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/projeto-01/group/fundamentos-2/lesson/preparando-seu-ambiente-de-desenvolvimento)


In this class we present to you the documentation that we created especially to configure your environment in React Native:

**[Rocketseat Docs](https://react-native.rocketseat.dev/)**

For this first project you will only need the Managed Workflow environment, but later on we will use Bare Workflow, so if you want to configure both environments at once, feel free.
