# Getting started with React

## [Introduction](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/chapter-i-6/group/iniciando-com-react/lesson/ignition-sequence-start-react-js)

## [React Fundamentals](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/chapter-i-6/group/iniciando-com-react/lesson/fundamentos-do-react-js)

In this class we will learn about the main fundamentals of [React](https://react.dev/).

We will see some concepts ranging from the principles of React and its purposes, to concepts such as SPA vs SSR and comparisons with traditional applications without using React.

## [Bundlers & Compilers](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/chapter-i-6/group/iniciando-com-react/lesson/bundlers-and-compilers)


With the developing of the world evolving all the time, not all browsers can keep up with the evolution of technology to support the most modern syntax.

For this there are compilers, such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) that convert modern code to an older syntax that browsers recognize, and bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) which bundles all of our application's files in a way that all browsers recognize.

In this class we will learn the difference between compilers and bundlers, and also about the new features that already exist in the most modern browsers, which is the ESModules feature.

We will also have an introduction to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which will replace traditional bundlers and compilers (such as babel and webpack) and understand how it takes advantage of the most modern browser features to have better compilation and execution performance.

## [Creating a React project](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/chapter-i-6/group/iniciando-com-react/lesson/criando-um-projeto-react)

In this class we will see how to start a ReactJS project using Vite, through the guide [Getting Started](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

We will also understand and clean the entire application structure that is generated by this tool to start developing our app.

### Installing NodeJS

In this class, we will also guide you on how to install Node.js, focusing on the LTS (Long Term Support) version. The LTS version is recommended as it receives long-term support.

On the date of recording, the LTS version was 16.15.0, but you can always choose the LTS version available at the time you are watching the class.

### Node.js installation methods

During the class, we will present two ways to install Node.js:

1. **Installation via the official website**: You can follow the installation steps on the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en). The site will provide an appropriate installer for your environment.
2. **Using a version manager**: If you are a more advanced user, you can opt for a version manager for Node.js, making it easier to switch and use different versions of Node.js as needed.

During class, we will explore the [n](https://github.com/tj/n), a tool available for Unix systems, such as MacOS, Linux and Windows using WSL.

If you use Windows without WSL, we recommend using an alternative, or installing the first option using the installer from the official website. An example of an alternative tool to `n` is the use of [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

### Class Content

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

```bash
> Ok to proceed? (y): y
√ Project name: 01-fundamentals
√ Select a framework: » React
√ Select a variant: » JavaScript
```

```bash
npm i
```

1. Remover todos arquivos `*.css` e `*.svg`
2. Atualizar os seguintes arquivos para:

```jsx title="src/App.jsx"
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!!!</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

```jsx title="src/main.jsx"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.jsx";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## [Components](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/chapter-i-6/group/iniciando-com-react/lesson/componentes-1)

Now that we have the entire React structure ready to develop our app, let's understand one of the most important concepts of React, which is componentization.
