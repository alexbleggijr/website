# React

:::note
In order to build my knowledge repository, after 10 years of experience in web development, I found interesting to recycle the knowledge I had previously. For this reason, certificates are presented from 2024 onwards.

## About

- **299 Classes**
- **6 Challenges**
- **41 Tests**

On this trail you will learn about the essential topics of React for the Web, venture into the ecosystem and learn in practice all the possibilities that this library has to offer. The trail begins with the introduction with the three pillars of the library: State, Property and Component and takes you until you put the applications into production, with automated testing and deployments.

With a more practical approach, you will create several projects along the way, from simpler applications such as a simplified social feed to the development of a pizzeria administration dashboard, with order management and communication with its own API.
