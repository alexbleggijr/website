reading books **<span style={{color: "var(--ifm-color-primary)"}}>_(Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Saxon Stories...)_</span>**, gaming **<span style={{color: "var(--ifm-color-primary)"}}>_(Doom, Diablo, Dead Space...)_</span>**, watching series

**Now, a bit of my background in web development...**

I started my journey in web development back in 2001. I attended high school and technical school at the same time and in 2003 I graduated with a technical degree in software development. I graduated with a good base in algorithms,
Delphi and SQL database development, however my affinity for chemistry and mathematics at the time was greater, so I deviated a little from software development to study chemical engineering. I ended up attending
halfway through the course when I had a feeling that it was not quite what I'd like to pursue a career in. I saved some money and went to study English in Sydney where I spent 3 years. In 2013 I returned to Brazil and resumed my
studies in software development.

In 2014 I finally started my career in software development in a small **<span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>[software factory](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axys/)</span>** as a front-end developer working mainly with email marketing, hotsites, institutional websites and e-commerces.
During the 2 years I worked there, I acquired solid foundations in **HTML**, **CSS**, **Web Accessibility**, **JavaScript**, **JQuery**, **Bootstrap**, **Less**, **Sass**, **Grunt**, **Gulp** and **AnuglarJS**.

In 2016 I started working at **<span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>[Medgrupo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/medgrupo/)</span>**, one of the largest medical education companies on the world, where I still working at the present day.
At Medgrupo I had the opportunity to work on several projects where I acquired knowledge and experience in various technologies and development tools such as **Angular**, **Vue**, **React**, **Stencil**, **Storybook**, **Ionic**, **GSAP**, **Ionic Animations/Gestures** and many other.
If you wish, check out the **<span style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>[full list](https://alexbleggi.netlify.app/knowledge)</span>** of all tools and technologies with which I have knowledge and experience.

At the moment I'm working as **Tech Lead of UI/UX and Design System development**, being part of the UI/UX and Design System team formed by 3 developers responsible for building and maintaining the company's Design System and all related UI/UX development. I'm currently working with:

But experience alone doesn't make a good developer, right?... I value a lot for learning and continuous evolution. I'm always looking to improve myself and I'm currently studying:
